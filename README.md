ðŸ§  Text Representation in NLP

This project delves into various techniques for representing text data in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers foundational methods like Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), as well as advanced approaches such as Word2Vec and BERT embeddings. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different text representation methods can be implemented and compared.
